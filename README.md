## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)

NumHacks was built in a group of 4 as part of a 12 hour long hackathon hosted by MV Hacks 7.0 (https://www.mvhacks.dev/).

Project Description : 
Existing math games are effective in improving people's skills, but often miss the game aspect. In other words, they are usually not very fun to play. So we created HexNums, a witch-themed simple math game that improves the userâ€™s math and logic skills while keeping it fun! We included various game aspects such as a wizard teacher who emotionally responds to the users playing, a health score, cool wands, and more :)
